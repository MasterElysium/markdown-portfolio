As of currently, I am fairly new and getting started into programming. Hopefully I'll learn new things and earn experience to make greater contributions in the future. I'm already fairly profficient at **C++** and **HTML/CSS**. My grasp on **Javascript** is quite basic. Additionally I'm looking to learn **Python**. But I'm very open minded and eager to learn more about programming methods, techniques and languages to start my professional career.
