As of currently, I am fairly new and getting started into programming. Hopefully I'll learn new things and earn experience to make greater contributions in the future. I'm already fairly profficient at **C++** and **HTML/CSS**. My grasp on **Javascript** is quite basic. Additionally I'm looking to learn **Python**. But I'm very open minded and eager to learn more about programming methods, techniques and languages to start my professional career.
<br>Completely unrelated, I am also a big fan of storytelling. Sometimes I do **writing and editting** and mess with concepts such as **fictional character creation** and **fictional world building**. Will be definitely looking forward into working on gaming projects, either as programmer or writer.</br>
